1) We can have 2 functions with the same name, but we need to have different parameters. The parameters can be of different types as well. This concept in JAVA is called method overloading.

Points to note:-
    - number of parameters can be different
    - but if the type of the methods even though different with the same number of parameters are not allowed

2) Inside JVM (Java Virtual Machine) which executes the code, we have 2 parts:
    - Stack (stores values in LIFO order)
    - Heap memory (open space)

3) Instance variables and local variables. Every method has its own stack.
