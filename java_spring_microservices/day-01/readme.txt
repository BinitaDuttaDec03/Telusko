1) We need java to run our code and javac to compile our code.

2) jshell can be used in the command prompt to directly run java code.

3) Java is a platform-independent language, i.e. it can run on any machine. The only requirement is that the machine should have JVM installed.

4) JVM - Java Virtual Machine. It is used to execute java application. It is platform-dependent. JVM understands byte code.

5) User --> Java Code --> Compiler (JavaC) --> Byte Code --> Run on JVM

6) There can be millions of files and folders, but you need to have one entry-point file that needs to have a main() method. Your code will only work if you provide a valid signature.

7) The extension for byte code is '.class' and the extension for java file is '.java'. The name of the file should match the class you are using.

8) To run a file use 'javac' to generate the byte code and 'java' to run your code.

9) JVM is a part of JRE(Java Runtime Environment). JVM + libraries = JRE.

10) Outer [JDK(Java Development Kit)] --> Inner [JRE] --> Innermost [JVM].

11) To run your code on another machine, you only need JRE and JVM. That's why JAVA is WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere). The JRE is installed on the OS(Operating System).

12) Java is a strongly-typed language. That means you have to specify the type of the variable.
