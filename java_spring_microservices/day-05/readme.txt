1) A stack will have a key and a value pair. 

2) The heap contains the object. This object has 2 sections. The 1st section has all the instance variables. This object has its own address. So there is a link between the stack and the heap with the address.

3) int arr2[] = new int[4]; --> by default all the values are assigned to 0

4) Drawbacks of an array in Java:
    a) You cannot increase the size of an array. 
    b) For searching and insetion, it takes some time.

5) Exceptions are runtime errors.
